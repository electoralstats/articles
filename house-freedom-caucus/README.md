This contains the code used to generate the data for the article [Just How Important is the House Freedom Caucus?](http://electoralstatistics.com/just-how-important-is-the-house-freedom-caucus/). `Scraper.py` does the actual scraping of the House Clerk website to get the data and `RepubDissent.py` takes that data and processes it, producing `DII_allvotes.csv` and `DII_justbills.csv`. `DII_master.xls` is a spreadsheet that combines this data and does some processing of it to get the statistics used in the article.
